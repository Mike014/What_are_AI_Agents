    "In the context of an agent, the model refers to the **language model (LM)** that serves as the **agent's decision-making center**. It can be composed of one or more models of various sizes, **capable of following logics and reasoning frameworks such as ReAct, Chain-of-Thought or Tree-of-Thoughts**.\n",

    "**Language models**, while powerful in generating text and images, **cannot interact directly with the outside world**. To overcome this limitation, tools allow agents to access external data and perform real actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tools can have different levels of complexity** and **generally operate via web APIs** with **methods such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE**. For example, an agent can use a tool to update a customer's information in a database or to obtain weather data to provide travel recommendations.\n",

    "- **Reasoning**: Decides which dishes can be prepared.\n",

    "- **Adaptation**: If an ingredient runs out or a customer provides feedback, the chef modifies the recipe in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents operate with a similar logic: **they process information, make decisions, and refine their actions based on the results obtained**. At the core of this architecture is the **orchestration layer**, which manages memory, state, reasoning, and planning. Orchestration is driven by **prompt engineering frameworks** that enhance the agent's interaction with the environment.\n",

    "Agents can use different **reasoning approaches**, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReAct (Reason + Act)**\n",
    "   - A framework that allows agents to **reason before acting**, improving response consistency and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "   - It has been shown to outperform many state-of-the-art AI solutions and increase user trust in LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**\n",
    "   - A technique that breaks down reasoning into **intermediate steps**, helping models perform complex tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of an Agent with ReAct**\n",
    "When a user sends a request, an agent using the **ReAct** framework follows this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The user sends a query to the agent.**\n",
    "2. **The agent initiates the ReAct sequence:**\n",
    "   - **Thought**: What to do based on the query.\n",
    "   - **Action**: Decides on an action (e.g., search for flights, perform a web search, write code).\n",
    "   - **Tools**: Selects an appropriate tool, such as a flight API.\n",
    "   - **Observation**: Obtains the tool's results and updates its reasoning.\n",
    "3. **The Thought → Action → Observation cycle continues until an optimal response is obtained.**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "The quality of agent responses depends on their **ability to reason and select the right tools**. Like a chef using fresh ingredients and listening to customer feedback, an AI agent must **rely on reliable information and a solid decision-making process** to deliver accurate and useful results.\n",

    "The **ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting) framework is a prompting technique for large language models (LLMs) that combines reasoning with action to improve performance on complex tasks. Introduced by Yao et al. in 2022, ReAct allows models to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, enabling greater synergy between the two. Reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans, as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical ReAct prompt consists of a task description, few-shot examples showing the desired format, and alternating steps of \"Thought\", \"Action\", and \"Observation\". For example, for a complex question, the model might:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought**: Determine what information is needed.\n",
    "2. **Action**: Perform a search to obtain that information.\n",
    "3. **Observation**: Analyze the search results.\n",
    "4. **Thought**: Synthesize the gathered information.\n",
    "5. **Action**: Provide the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the model to dynamically update its knowledge and make more informed decisions, improving the accuracy and interpretability of responses. ReAct has been successfully applied to various tasks, including question answering, fact-checking, and decision-making in complex environments, outperforming methods based solely on reasoning or action."

    "1. **Functions do not directly execute API calls**\n",
    "   - The model generates a function with parameters but does not directly execute it on an external API.\n",
    "   - APIs are called from the **client-side** (e.g., an external application), not by the AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functions are executed client-side, while extensions are agent-side**\n",
    "   - **Extensions** are integrated into the agent's architecture and directly interact with external APIs.\n",
    "   - **Functions** are executed by **client-side software**, giving the programmer more control over the interaction with APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Flight Booking with Functions vs. Extensions**\n",
    "- With an **Extension**, the agent directly calls the **Google Flights API** and returns the results to the user.\n",
    "- With a **Function**, the agent decides which function to use, but the API call is handled **elsewhere**, such as in the **client backend or middleware**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Why use Functions instead of Extensions?**\n",
    "- **If the API call needs to occur at another level** of the application (e.g., frontend, middleware).\n",
    "- **For security or authentication reasons**, if the API is not directly accessible by the agent.\n",
    "- **For batch operations or human review**, where APIs need to be called in a specific order.\n",
    "- **To transform data before passing it to the agent**, if the API does not offer filtering tools.\n",
    "- **To develop and test agents without modifying existing APIs** (e.g., simulating API calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "**Functions** give developers more control, separating the AI agent's logic from the API infrastructure, while **Extensions** allow for more direct and automated integration. The choice depends on the **security constraints, data flow, and customization needs** of the application.\n",
    "In summary, **AI agents operate similarly to a programming script** but with an additional level of intelligence and automation. **They autonomously decide which functions to use and how to execute them**, allowing them to respond effectively and dynamically to user requests."

    "### **Data Stores: The Solution for Dynamic Data in AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language models** are like a **large library** containing everything learned during training. However, **they cannot automatically update with new information**, which is a limitation when real-world knowledge changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Stores solve this problem** by providing access to **real-time updated data**, keeping the model's responses **more accurate and relevant**.\n",

    "**With Data Stores**, the agent can directly access this data without needing to:\n",

    "- **Retrain the model**\n",
    "- **Perform fine-tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the integration work?**\n",
    "1. The **Data Store** converts the document into **vector embeddings** (a mathematical representation of the data).\n",
    "2. The agent uses these embeddings to **extract useful information** when needed.\n",
    "3. The model can then **combine the Data Store's data with its pre-trained knowledge** to generate more accurate responses.\n",

    "1. The user sends a question to the AI agent.\n",
    "2. The query is converted into **vector embeddings**.\n",
    "3. These embeddings are **compared** with those in the **vector database**.\n",
    "4. The most relevant content is retrieved and passed to the AI agent.\n",
    "5. The agent combines the information and provides a response to the user.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "**Data Stores allow AI agents to access updated and accurate information without needing to retrain the model.**\n",
    "- They are ideal for applications **based on documents, knowledge bases, and structured data retrieval**.\n",
    "- **RAG + ReAct** enhances the decision-making process of AI agents, making them **smarter and contextually aware**.\n",
