    "## The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle\n",
    "An AI Agent follows a continuous loop of three phases:\n",
    "1. **Thought**: The LLM analyzes the request and decides the next step.\n",
    "2. **Action**: The Agent performs an action by calling the appropriate Tool.\n",
    "3. **Observation**: The Agent interprets the result and updates its reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle continues until the Agent's goal is achieved.\n",

    "### Example: Alfred, the Weather Agent\n",
    "Alfred is an AI Agent that answers weather-related questions.\n",

    "#### Thought\n",
    "- **User**: \"What's the weather like in New York today?\"\n",
    "- **Alfred thinks**: \"The user wants to know the current weather in New York. I need to call the weather Tool to get updated data.\"\n",

    "1. AI Agents iterate in a continuous cycle: Alfred follows the Thought → Action → Observation cycle until the goal is reached.\n",
    "2. Tools provide updated information: Without a Tool, Alfred would give inaccurate responses. With the Tool, he gets real-time data.\n",
    "3. AI Agents are adaptive: They update their reasoning based on new observations and can try alternative strategies if needed.\n",

    "## **1️⃣ Setting Up the System Prompt for the AI Agent**\n",
    "The **System Prompt** plays a crucial role, guiding the AI to properly format its responses and ensuring it follows a structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Defining the System Prompt**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way you use the tools is by specifying a JSON object.\n",
    "Specifically, this JSON should have an \"action\" key (with the name of the tool to use) and an \"action_input\" key (with the input to the tool parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"action\": \"get_weather\",\n",
    "  \"action_input\": {\"location\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this format:\n",
    "Question: the input question.\n",
    "Thought: decide on one action to take.\n",
    "Action: (JSON formatted)\n",
    "Observation: the result of the action.\n",
    "Final Answer: the definitive response.\n",

    "We will now set up **Llama 3.2** using **Hugging Face's API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Setting Up API Access**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",

    "<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ **The AI Agent will now generate a structured response following the prompt.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Executing the AI Agent’s Response**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = client.text_generation(\n",
    "    system_prompt,\n",
    "    max_new_tokens=200\n",
    ")\n",

    "output = client.text_generation(\n",

    "✔ **Now, the AI Agent will stop at the correct point, waiting for actual execution.**\n",

    "## **5️⃣ Storing and Using the Generated JSON**\n",
    "Once we generate the JSON output, we can **store it in a file** for execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6️⃣ Executing the JSON Action**\n",
    "Once the AI Agent has created an action, we need to **execute the function corresponding to the JSON action**.\n",

    "### **🔹 Loading JSON and Executing the Action**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dummy function to simulate a weather API call\n",

    "### **🔹 Concatenating Action, Execution, and Observation**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_prompt = system_prompt + output + get_weather(\"London\")\n",

    "## ** 8. Conclusion**\n",
    "✔ **We created a JSON AI Agent that follows the Thought → Action → Observation cycle.**  \n",
    "✔ **The AI Agent generates JSON-based actions dynamically.**  \n",
    "✔ **We implemented a way to store and execute these actions.**  \n",
